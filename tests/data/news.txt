A 14-year-old girl has been flown to hospital by air ambulance with serious head injuries after a horse collapsed on her in Norfolk.

East of England Ambulance Service crews were called at 15:08 BST to reports that the girl was trapped under a horse on Blackwater Lane, Great Witchingham.

The girl was airlifted by the Magpas Helimedix team to Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge.

The 999 caller said the horse had collapsed on top of the girl and died.

A joint police and Health and Safety Executive investigation is underway to examine the circumstances surrounding the incident.

A Norfolk Police spokesman said: "Although we're in the early stages of our investigation, early indications are that this was an accident."

The prison service has admitted liability after Milly Dowler's killer was attacked in jail.

Levi Bellfield claimed he suffered cuts in the incident at Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire last year, before his trial for murdering 13-year-old Milly.

Lawyers acting for Bellfield said they had been instructed to seek compensation for personal injury.

HM Prison Service said: "An admission of liability does not mean compensation will automatically be paid."

The statement added: "We have not received a detailed claim for compensation from Mr Bellfield or his legal representatives.

"For this reason it would be entirely inappropriate to comment any further at this stage."

'Duty of care'
Bellfield, a former wheelclamper and nightclub bouncer, was sentenced to a whole-life term in June after being convicted of abducting and murdering Milly Dowler in March 2002.

In 2008, he was given a whole-life term for murdering Marsha McDonnell, 19, in 2003 and murdering Amelie Delagrange, 22, and attempting to murder Kate Sheedy, 18, in 2004.

Jeremy Moore, of Carter Moore solicitors, said: "Our client was injured after the prison authorities, in breach of the duty of care which they owe to every prisoner, housed him on a wing of the prison that was unsuitable for a prisoner of his category.

"Subsequently, Mr Bellfield was attacked with a makeshift weapon by another prisoner causing injuries to his face and mouth.

"In February 2011 the prison authorities admitted full liability for this incident.

"We would add that, as with every UK citizen, our client has a right to seek compensation for injuries resulting from a negligent act or omission as a result of which he has suffered injury."

Rory McIlroy has said he is likely to play on the PGA Tour in the United States again after a one-year absence.

The US Open champion, 22, played the US circuit last season but then gave it up because he was missing Europe.

"I'm leaning towards taking my card here again - I'm comfortable in this country and I feel like my game suits the courses," said McIlroy, who is in Ohio for the Bridgestone Invitational.

"Most of my favourite events are in the US and I'd like to give it a go."

McIlroy picked out Quail Hollow, Memorial and Akron as being among his favourite courses.

He added: "You play the Match Play, Honda, Doral, Masters. You have your favourite events, and most of my favourite events seem to be on this side of the pond.

"I'm going to look at a few houses in Florida after the USPGA and I'm looking at maybe playing a full season over here.

"I seem to play my best golf here so it's something I'm looking at seriously."

McIlroy added that he regretted some of the comments he made after the final day of the Open at Royal St George's.

Maybe I should think about things a little bit more but it will not stop me tweeting or speaking my mind
Rory McIlroy on Townsend row
The Holywood player said at the time that he was unlikely to win an Open until there were good weather conditions and added that he would not be altering his game to suit links courses.

But he admitted on Wednesday: "I was very frustrated with how the weekend had gone at the Open.

"If I had to do it again I would probably have said something different but I just said what was on my mind at the time.

"I am always very honest in my interviews and try to give good answers."

McIlroy added that his controversial Twitter exchange with golf pundit Jay Townsend at the Irish Open last week had been "unfortunate".

Townsend had strongly criticised McIlroy's course management after his opening round at Killarney, comments which the world number five took exception to, urging the analyst to "shut up".

"I was just off the golf course, having carded a double bogey at the last - I saw a couple of comments and responded to them," said McIlroy.

"That's the world we live in now - everything is instant and in the public domain.

"Maybe I should think about things a little bit more but it will not stop me Tweeting or speaking my mind.

"During the weeks I am playing tournaments I try not to go on Twitter too much or look at what people are saying."

Nine Mexican opinion pollsters have been freed several days after they disappeared in the western state of Michoacan.

The polling firm Parametria said its three employees were released just hours after six workers for Mitofsky Consulting had also been freed.

No details have been given as to who may have held them.

The pollsters disappeared while carrying out surveys in an area known to be a stronghold of drug gangs.

President of Mitofsky Consulting Roy Campos said the five men and one woman who worked for his firm were safe and with their families.

The six had disappeared while working in the city of Apatzingan on Saturday.

The three Parametria employees went missing in the same area on Monday.

Parametria Director Francisco Abundis told local media the captors had held his employees until they had made sure they "weren't people working undercover".

Michoacan Attorney General Jesus Montejano confirmed all nine were now free.

He said their disappearance had been "unusual", and added that no ransom had been paid for their release.

He said he believed their disappearance "could be a linked to one of the criminal groups that operate in the area".

Apatzingan is the stronghold of the La Familia drug cartel, and a rival gang calling itself the Knights Templar.

The area has seen a rise in violence blamed on the break-up of La Familia.

Officials say the killing by the security forces in December of the gang's leader, Nazario Moreno, has severely weakened La Familia.

But analysts say the Knights Templar, an offshoot of the cartel, has taken over many of La Familia's operations.

Apatzingan is at the centre of the battle between the two factions for control of the area's methamphetamine production.
